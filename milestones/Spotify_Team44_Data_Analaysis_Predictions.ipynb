    "## Primary Data Set and Platforms for Sharing our Data: Replicable Science\n",
    "The primary data source in this project was the **Million Playlist Dataset** provided by Spotify as part of the RecSys Challenge 2018.\n",
    "https://labs.spotify.com/2018/05/30/introducing-the-million-playlist-dataset-and-recsys-challenge-2018/\n",
    "The challenge ended on June 30th of 2018, so we used an archival copy of the dataset provided to us by the course staff.\n",
    "All source code for this project is on a public GitHub Respository \n",
    "https://github.com/IACS-CS-209-Group44/Spotify\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, Git and GitHub are not well suited to working on large files, especially large binary files.\n",
    "Because of the large size of this data set, we were forced to use a shared folder on Dropbox to share large files.\n",
    "This makes it more challenging for us to share our data with the public and create a conveniently reproducible set of calculations.  We are committed to the goal of fully reproducible science including data science with large files.\n",
    "For a full scale research undertaking with a suitable budget, two ideas to better achieve this goal would be to host a publicly available database instance using a service like AWS and / or to share a container instance.  These techniques are beyond the scope of this project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data on our Dropbox includes several formats that make it easy to replicate almost all of our work.  The h5 data files allow all of our imported data and results of calculations into Pandas dataframes.  There is also a database backup available in the file `SpotifyDB.bak`.  Warning: this is a bit of a monster, weighing in at **165 GB**, so it's not for the faint of heart.  Anyone with access to a moderately powerful SQL Server instance, either on-premises or on the cloud, can restore this database from \n",
    "Anyone who is interested in accessing our dataset may email me at mse99@g.harvard.edu or michael.s.emanuel@gmail.com to request access to this dataset.  Any reasonable request will be granted read only access to the shared folder for as long as it is up.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The JSON Data Set and the Choice of SQL Server Backend\n",
    "The data provided by the mpd consists of 1000 json files.  Each file is a \"slice\" of 1,000 playlists.  There are 1,000 of these slice files that together comprise the 1,000,000 playlists in the data set.  The JSON files are a highly denormalized representation of the data, meaning they have a large amount of duplicated or redundant data.  As one prominent example, each spotify track has a unique identifier, and a track name associated with this identifier.  The JSON files duplicate the full track name when describing each track entry.  We stored the data in a fully normalized format, with separate database tables for the logical entities of a Track, Playlist, PlaylistEntry, etc.  I will describe our data model in greater detail below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice to use SQL Server as our back end for data was an important strategic decision on this project.  \n",
    "The JSON respresentation of the data is convenient for a person reviewing the data, but is extremely inefficient for doing large scale computations.  As one example of how slow the JSON / Python API is, the data set comes with some Python utilities that do very simple summary calculations such as tabulating the most popular tracks.  This utility was on pace to take over 90 minutes to run on my desktop PC, which has top of the line hardware for a desktop computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was clear that we needed a far more efficient back end for storing our data in a more normalized form.  Most people in this course would probably have chosen to use Pandas and persisted a series of data frames.  That is a completely sound choice.  In my particular case, I have spent many years working with SQL (first MySQL, then SQL Server).  I have also invested a large amount of time and money configuring an instance of SQL Server running on a high performance server sitting on a rack in my basement.  By comparison, I am very new to Pandas.  I'm now proficient for basic tasks, but I have often spent hours trying to figure out how to do an operation I could do in a matter of minutes in SQL Server.  It is often true that the best tool for a given job is the one you know how to use.  For me and this problem, that tool was SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Import into SQL Server\n",
    "The first step was to understand the data and break it up into logical entities.  Each logical entity corresponds to its own database table.  The four most important logical entities in this data set are Artist, Album, Track, and Playlist.  I am going to go out of order for a moment and jump ahead to the Pandas dataframes that we used for downstream computations.  The code below loads these frames from an h5 data file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before this code will run, please copy the files `data.h5` and `playlist_entry.h5` from the Dropbox folder to the directory where you cloned the GitHub repo.  On my system, the repo is cloned to `D:\\IACS-CS-209-Spotify\\` and the Dropbox folder is at `D:\\Dropbox\\IACS-CS-209-Spotify\\`.  I copy the file `D:\\Dropbox\\IACS-CS-209-Spotify\\mpd\\database_export\\h5` into `D:\\IACS-CS-209-Spotify\\data\\data.h5`.  I do the analogous operation for files `playlist_entry.h5` and `track_pair.h5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to automate all of this in a very slick and convenient way using GitHub LFS.  https://git-lfs.github.com/\n",
    "But this is a paid service that costs at least \\$10 a month, possibly quite a bit more given the size of this data set.  I spent several hours investigating alternatives that would allow us to bypass this manual copy step to synchronize the Dropbox folder, but did not come up with a better procedure.  Once the file `data.h5` is in place, the code below will load the data frames for Artist, Album, Track, and Playlist into memory."

    "### Comments on the Table Design\n",
    "The design of these database tables follows a few simple best practices.  All tables have an integer ID as their primary key.  This gives a large boost to the performance of queries that join tables.  Searching for an integer entry in an index is a much faster operation than comparings strings.  The original JSON data model did not have any integer IDs for any of these entities besides for the playlist ID.  All entities that exist in Spotify also have a field that Spotify names a Uri.  These are string identefiers.  These fields are equipped with unique constraints, building in both a data integrity check and causing SQL server to build indexes that both enforce the constraint and support fast joins on these fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Track table demonstrates foreign key relationships.  The fields ArtistID and AlbumID are foreign keys onto the Artist and Album tables, respectively.  Note that no redundant information such as the ArtistName or ArtistUri are stored in the Track table.  Any consumer of this information is expected to get it by joining the Artist table using ArtistID.  The foreign key relationships are enforeced with foreign key constraints.  The primary key on the Track table is TrackID, and there is a separate unique constraint on the TrackUri.\n",
    "\n",
    "This table also demonstrates a consistent naming scheme followed in the SpotifyDB database.  The name of the integer primary key on the table Artist is ArtistID.  This is one popular approach.  Another approach is to name the field ID.  I prefer to name the field ArtistID because then when you join from the Track table to the Artist table, the join clause uses the field AristID on both sides of the equality.  There are multiple naming approaches that are strong.  As is often the case, the most important thing is to pick one strategy and then follow it consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all you SQL aficianados out there, below please find the SQL table definitions for the main logical entities comprising the MPD dataset.  (Don't worry, I won't include all 42 tables in the database, just a few of the important ones!).  The entirety of the SQL used in this project can be found in the `sql` directory under the GitHub repo.  The files are named with a numeric prefix, so that tables are built in the correct order.  As an example, the Track table references the Artist and Album tables, so Artist and Album must be created first.  The relevant SQL scripts are named `03_MakeTable_Artist.sql`,  `04_MakeTable_Album.sql`, and `05_MakeTable_Track.sql`."

    "The cells below present the contents of the file `src/db_import.py`.  This program was run from the terminal and it populated the two raw tables **r.Playlist** and **r.PlaylistEntry** by reading the JSON files.  In principle, someone trying to replicate our work could run this script on their local system.  They would need to modify the function `getConnection()` though because it is currently configured to acquire a connection to my database instance, which is on a server named `Thor` and an instance named `Mjolnir`.  (Of course, if the user is a fan of Norse mythology or the Marvel Universe, they might *already* have a SQL Server Instance with this name, but it seems... unlikely.)  Just change `Thor` to the name of your SQL Server and `Mjolnir` to the name of your instance and it should work with an on-premises setup.  I don't know the exact steps to configure it on AWS but it should be straightforward."
