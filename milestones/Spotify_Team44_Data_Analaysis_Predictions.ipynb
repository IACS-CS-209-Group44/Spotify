    "# Data Acquisition & Import\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sharing our Data for Replicable Science\n",
    "The primary data source in this project was the **Million Playlist Dataset** provided by Spotify as part of the RecSys Challenge 2018.\n",
    "https://labs.spotify.com/2018/05/30/introducing-the-million-playlist-dataset-and-recsys-challenge-2018/\n",
    "The challenge ended on June 30th of 2018, so we used an archival copy of the dataset provided to us by the course staff.\n",
    "All source code for this project is on a public GitHub Respository \n",
    "https://github.com/IACS-CS-209-Group44/Spotify\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, Git and GitHub are not well suited to working on large files, especially large binary files.\n",
    "Because of the large size of this data set, we were forced to use a shared folder on Dropbox to share large files.\n",
    "This makes it more challenging for us to share our data with the public and create a conveniently reproducible set of calculations.  We are committed to the goal of fully reproducible science including data science with large files.\n",
    "For a full scale research undertaking with a suitable budget, two ideas to better achieve this goal would be to host a publicly available database instance using a service like AWS and / or to share a container instance.  These techniques are beyond the scope of this project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data on our Dropbox includes several formats that make it easy to replicate almost all of our work.  The h5 data files allow all of our imported data and results of calculations into Pandas dataframes.  There is also a database backup available in the file `SpotifyDB.bak`.  Warning: this is a bit of a monster, weighing in at **165 GB**, so it's not for the faint of heart.  Someone with access to a moderately powerful SQL Server instance, either on-premises or on the cloud, can restore this database from the backup file.\n",
    "Anyone who is interested in accessing our dataset may email me at mse99@g.harvard.edu or michael.s.emanuel@gmail.com to request access to this dataset.  Any reasonable request will be granted read only access to the shared folder on Dropbox for as long as it is up.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The JSON Data Set and the Choice of SQL Server Backend\n",
    "The data provided by the mpd consists of 1000 json files.  Each file is a \"slice\" of 1,000 playlists.  There are 1,000 of these slice files that together comprise the 1,000,000 playlists in the data set.  The JSON files are a highly denormalized representation of the data, meaning they have a large amount of duplicated or redundant data.  As one prominent example, each spotify track has a unique identifier, and a track name associated with this identifier.  The JSON files duplicate the full track name when describing each track entry.  We stored the data in a fully normalized format, with separate database tables for the logical entities of a Track, Playlist, PlaylistEntry, etc.  I will describe our data model in greater detail below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice to use SQL Server as our back end for data was an important strategic decision on this project.  \n",
    "The JSON respresentation of the data is convenient for a person reviewing the data, but is extremely inefficient for doing large scale computations.  As one example of how slow the JSON / Python API is, the data set comes with some Python utilities that do very simple summary calculations such as tabulating the most popular tracks.  This utility was on pace to take over 90 minutes to run on my desktop PC, which has top of the line hardware for a desktop computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was clear that we needed a far more efficient back end for storing our data in a more normalized form.  Most people in this course would probably have chosen to use Pandas and persisted a series of data frames.  That is a completely sound choice.  In my particular case, I have spent many years working with SQL (first MySQL, then SQL Server).  I have also invested a large amount of time and money configuring an instance of SQL Server running on a high performance server sitting on a rack in my basement.  By comparison, I am very new to Pandas.  I'm now proficient for basic tasks, but I have often spent hours trying to figure out how to do an operation I could do in a matter of minutes in SQL Server.  It is often true that the best tool for a given job is the one you know how to use.  For me and this problem, that tool was SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Import into SQL Server\n",
    "The first step was to understand the data and break it up into logical entities.  Each logical entity corresponds to its own database table.  The four most important logical entities in this data set are Artist, Album, Track, and Playlist.  I am going to go out of order for a moment and jump ahead to the Pandas dataframes that we used for downstream computations.  The code below loads these frames from an h5 data file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before this code will run, please copy the files `data.h5` and `playlist_entry.h5` from the Dropbox folder to the directory where you cloned the GitHub repo.  On my system, the repo is cloned to `D:\\IACS-CS-209-Spotify\\` and the Dropbox folder is at `D:\\Dropbox\\IACS-CS-209-Spotify\\`.  I copy the file `D:\\Dropbox\\IACS-CS-209-Spotify\\mpd\\database_export\\h5` into `D:\\IACS-CS-209-Spotify\\data\\data.h5`.  I do the analogous operation for files `playlist_entry.h5` and `track_pair.h5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to automate all of this in a very slick and convenient way using GitHub LFS.  https://git-lfs.github.com/\n",
    "But this is a paid service that costs at least \\$10 a month, possibly quite a bit more given the size of this data set.  I spent several hours investigating alternatives that would allow us to bypass this manual copy step to synchronize the Dropbox folder, but did not come up with a better procedure.  Once the file `data.h5` is in place, the code below will load the data frames for Artist, Album, Track, and Playlist into memory."

    "### Comments on the Table Design\n",
    "The design of these database tables follows a few simple best practices.  All tables have an integer ID as their primary key.  This gives a large boost to the performance of queries that join tables.  Searching for an integer entry in an index is a much faster operation than comparings strings.  The original JSON data model did not have any integer IDs for any of these entities besides for the playlist ID.  All entities that exist in Spotify also have a field that Spotify names a Uri.  These are string identefiers.  These fields are equipped with unique constraints, building in both a data integrity check and causing SQL server to build indexes that both enforce the constraint and support fast joins on these fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Track table demonstrates foreign key relationships.  The fields ArtistID and AlbumID are foreign keys onto the Artist and Album tables, respectively.  Note that no redundant information such as the ArtistName or ArtistUri are stored in the Track table.  Any consumer of this information is expected to get it by joining the Artist table using ArtistID.  The foreign key relationships are enforeced with foreign key constraints.  The primary key on the Track table is TrackID, and there is a separate unique constraint on the TrackUri.\n",
    "\n",
    "This table also demonstrates a consistent naming scheme followed in the SpotifyDB database.  The name of the integer primary key on the table Artist is ArtistID.  This is one popular approach.  Another approach is to name the field ID.  I prefer to name the field ArtistID because then when you join from the Track table to the Artist table, the join clause uses the field AristID on both sides of the equality.  There are multiple naming approaches that are strong.  As is often the case, the most important thing is to pick one strategy and then follow it consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all you SQL aficianados out there, below please find the SQL table definitions for the main logical entities comprising the MPD dataset.  (Don't worry, I won't include all 42 tables in the database, just a few of the important ones!).  The entirety of the SQL used in this project can be found in the `sql` directory under the GitHub repo.  The files are named with a numeric prefix, so that tables are built in the correct order.  As an example, the Track table references the Artist and Album tables, so Artist and Album must be created first.  The relevant SQL scripts are named `03_MakeTable_Artist.sql`,  `04_MakeTable_Album.sql`, and `05_MakeTable_Track.sql`."

    "The cells below present the contents of the file `src/db_import.py`.  This program was run from the terminal and it populated the two raw tables **r.Playlist** and **r.PlaylistEntry** by reading the JSON files.  In practice, if you are replicating our results the best strategy is probably to restore database from SpotifyDB.bak.  In principle, someone trying to replicate our work could run this script on their local system.  They would need to modify the function `getConnection()` though because it is currently configured to acquire a connection to my database instance, which is on a server named `Thor` and an instance named `Mjolnir`.  (Of course, if you are a fan of Norse mythology or the Marvel Universe, you might *already* have a SQL Server Instance with this name, but it seems... unlikely.)  Just change `Thor` to the name of your SQL Server and `Mjolnir` to the name of your instance and it should work with an on-premises setup.  I don't know the exact steps to configure it on AWS but it should be straightforward."

    "# Predicting the Last 10 Tracks of a Playlist\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spotify app offers users a functionality suggesting tracks you might want to add to a playlist.  It recommends 10 tracks.  If you don't like any of them, it will recommend another 10, and so on.  We set as our first task building a predictive model that could predict the last 10 tracks of a playlist by looking at features including the first $n-10$ tracks and the name of the playlist.  This problem is easy to state but hard to solve in practice.  The data set is truly massive.  There are 1,000,000 playlist and 2.26 million distinct tracks appearing.  Scaling the problem down by considering only a smaller number of playlists at a time is a straightforward to make the scale more manageable.  But we found it very challenging to deal with the huge number of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first idea we discussed was to simply cut off consideration of tracks that were not among the most popular, e.g. the top 100,000 tracks.  There are a few issues with this.  This data set has a very long tail.  The first 100,000 tracks are dominant, but they only comprise 84\\% of the total number of entries of the on the PlaylistEntry table.  (This calculation was done in the database view `v.TopTracks`).  And even if you did reduce the size of this data set to 100,000 columns, the scale is still so massive that dense matrices are infeasible.  With so many features, reducing the number of rows (playlists) you study is dangerous.  Suppose for the sake of discussion we reduced it by a factor of 10, dropping down to 100,000.  The matrix representing playlist entries would still have a size of 100,000 x 100,000, i.e. it would have $10^10$ or 10 billion entries in it.  That is a lot of memory and is not going to be feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all we wanted to do was one or two basic linear algebra operations, then it is feasible load this data into sparse matrices.  Care must be taken arrange the input into the right shape, and to only perform fast operations.  As an example, if you want to perform matrix multiplication on A * B, this will work efficiently if A is in 'csr' (compressed sparse row) and B is in 'csc' (compressed sparse column) format.  Otherwise it is going to be very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest problem with reducing the number of tracks under consideration though was the ambitious goal of the project: to produce recommendations that had a higher frequency of artists in a \"promoted\" group.  In this case, the promoted group consisted of female mid-tier artists.  Avriel generated a list of ~14,000 female midtier artists currently on Spotify, which matched up with about 10,000 artists in our dataset (out of about 295,000 artists total).  These artists accounted for a tiny 0.8576\\% of total playlist recommendations with the default model which uses baseline frequencies.  The upshot is that a model that limits the tracks to the top 100,000 or even the top 200,000 is going to be hopeless at recommending tracks deep in this long tail-it may as well be guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we contemplated the extent of this challenge and the limited time available, we chose to concentrate on three very straightforward models:\n",
    "* Baseline Model: predict tracks based solely on their overall frequency in the training data set\n",
    "* Playlist Name Model: predict tracks based on one feature, the name of the playlist\n",
    "* Naive Bayes (Track Pair) Model: Predict a playlist by analyzing the frequency with which pairs of tracks appear together in the same playlist.  Sum up the frequencies of the \"other\" tracks given the visible tracks in a playlist, and guess the top 10 other tracks\n",
    "If time permitted, we also considered adding a fourth model:\n",
    "* Stacked Model: Predict playlist using a combination of the playlist name and track pair information.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I considered these three models, I realized that none of the first three required any \"fancy\" machine learning and could all be implemented cleanly in SQL.  Given the challenges of moving data from one platform to another and the limited time availabe, I chose to estimate the three basic models purely in SQL.  The benefit of doing this in SQL is that is highly scalable and running on powerful hardware.  All predictions were made on the full data set of one million playlists, split into 900,000 training and 100,000 test playlists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load in some additional dataframes so we can see examples of these predictions and their building blocks."

    "This model is about as simple as you can get short of randomly guessing one of the 2.26 million tracks.  Here is how it works in words.  Assemble a list of the most popular tracks in descending order.  The frequency here is how often this track appears as an entry in the training data set.  To predict the last 10 tracks, take the list of candidates, remove the tracks that have already been played, and guess the top 10.  That's it!\n",

    "This model is the second simplest model we could think of.  It only considers one feature of each playlist: the name of the playlist.  While this might sound simple, it is also a powerful feature.  The best way to see the power of this feature is to experiment with the Spotify app.  When I was putting together playlists so I could complete our survey, I started by typing in the names of three playlists.  I'm a classical music fan, and my playlists were titled \"Virtuoso Piano\", \"Symphonies\" and \"Chamber Music\".  Based only on these titles, Spotify gave me a roster of entirely plausible suggestions, tilted to be sure to the most popular works in each field, but all relevant.  The one million playlists included 73,498 distinct playlist names.  A review of these playlist names shows there are a lot of effective duplicates separated only by letter casing and punctuation.  Here is my favorite example: people like naming a playlist \"vibes\" with many variants..."

    "For each playlist name, I computed a PlaylistSimpleName field by stripping out leading and trailing spaces (using the TRIM function), removing all punctuation, and moving all letters to lowercase.  This reduced the count of distinct playlist simple names to 17,131.  For each of these simple names, I then tabulated the frequency with which tracks appeared in all the playlists that shared that simple name.  The prediction for a new playlist starts with candidates that are the most popular tracks sharing that playlist name.  If necessary, this is padded by considering tracks with a high baseline frequency.  (This is a rare corner case but it does happen if a playlist name is obscure and only appears a small number of times, perhaps once.)  If a playlist name is not recognized, it is mapped to the empty string.  This is also where playlist names containing only punctuation or non-ascii characters are mapped.  Here is the SQL script that generates predictions using the playlist simple name model."
